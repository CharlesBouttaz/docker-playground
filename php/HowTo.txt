FROM https://hub.docker.com/_/php/

$ docker build -t my-php-app .
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-php-app

We recommend that you add a custom php.ini configuration. COPY it into /usr/local/etc/php by adding one more line to the Dockerfile above and running the same commands to build and run:

FROM php:5.6-apache
COPY config/php.ini /usr/local/etc/php/
COPY src/ /var/www/html/

Where src/ is the directory containing all your php code and config/ contains your php.ini file.
